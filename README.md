# WECNexus

This code is created specifically for the Water-Energy-Carbon Nexus Class held in the 2023 Spring Semester of Kyung Hee University.
The main purpose of this code is to calculate the Water - Energy - Carbon footprint based on the causal relation of all the involved parameters such as population, housing policy, energy policy, etc.


The main code is **main.py** and the other two CSV files are necessary for running.
1. **data.csv** : this is the data sheet containing the required data from the city of Penticton to calculate the nexus
2. **params.csv** : this sheet contains the parameter required for predictions

The code was built in Pyhton 3.9, and only basic packages were used. To run it you will only need:
1. numpy
2. pandas





*postscriptum* I know this is not the prettiest code, but it works, so it's good enough
