# WECNexus

This code is created specifically for the Water-Energy-Carbon Nexus Class held in the 2023 Spring Semester of Kyung Hee University.

The main code is **main.py** and the 2 CSV files are necessary for running.
1. **data.csv** : this is the data sheet containing the required data from the city of Penticton to calculate the nexus
2. **params.csv** : this sheet contains the parameter required for predictions
